Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform that offers a wide range of IT services over the internet, including storage, databases, and computing power. Instead of purchasing and maintaining their own physical servers, companies can "rent" these services from AWS on a pay-as-you-go basis, allowing them to scale resources up or down as needed. Millions of customers, from startups to large enterprises and government agencies, use AWS to lower costs, increase agility, and innovate faster
